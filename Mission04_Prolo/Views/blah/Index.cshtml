<h3>What Do I Hope to get out of IS 413?</h3>
<p>
    The thing I hope to get out of IS 413 is to learn how to create efficient client- and server- sided programming.
    I desire to make professional looking webpages with front end and back end capabilities. I would also like to understand ASP.NET
    to help guide my programming to help me implement APIs, JavaScript, JQuery, and Bootstrap.
